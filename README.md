## About The Project

The State application has been meticulously crafted to function seamlessly as a desktop application within a diverse range of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux (GNU). Security is paramount, as cryptographic keypairs are securely stored in an encrypted format on your local machine. Access to the Zenotta network is facilitated exclusively through well-structured API calls, ensuring a robust and reliable connection.

Features include:

* Key-pair generation through the use of BIP39 mnemonic implementation.
* Encryption and decryption of key-pairs during operations safely.
* Transactions and complex network interactions simplified.

## Installation

To obtain the State wallet, users can conveniently access the download section located on our [releases](https://github.com/Zenotta/state-release/releases) page. It is imperative for end users to exercise diligence in selecting the appropriate binary that corresponds to their specific operating system. This ensures a seamless and compatible experience, enabling users to leverage the State wallet's functionalities effectively and securely.

## Getting Started

Upon launching the application for the first time, users will be prompted to create a new wallet or log into an existing one. The State wallet is compatible with the BIP39 mnemonic standard, which is a widely adopted industry standard for generating deterministic key-pairs.

Upon deciding to create a new wallet, the user will be prompted to enter a password which will be used to encrypt the wallet's key-pairs. Once a password is entered, the user can decide between generating a new seed phrase or importing an existing one by ticking the appropriate checkbox.

Open receiving a newly generated seed phrase, users will be prompted to confirm the seed phrase by selecting the correct combination of words in the appropriate order. It is imperative that users remember seed phrase upon creating a new wallet, as it is not possible to recover the wallet without it.

Once the wallet has been created, users will be presented with the main interface, which is divided into two main sections: the navigation bar and the wallet overview.
